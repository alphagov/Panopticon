Feature: Managing contacts
  In order that citizens know who to talk to if GovUK doesn't answer their question
  I want to connect contacts and artefacts
  This feature is not currently in use

  Background:
    Given I am an admin

#  Scenario: Assign a contact
#    Given an artefact exists
#      And a contact exists
#    When I add the contact to the artefact
#    Then I should be redirected to Publisher
#      And the API should say that the artefact has the contact

#  Scenario: Unassign a contact
#    Given an artefact exists
#      And a contact exists
#      And the artefact has the contact
#    When I remove the contact from the artefact
#    Then I should be redirected to Publisher
#      And the API should say that the artefact does not have the contact
